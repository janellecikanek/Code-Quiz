# Code-Quiz

## Description

As a coding student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. I can then gauge my progress compared to my peers. To start taking the quiz the start button must be clicked. A timer will start and a question is presented. When the multiple choice question is answered another question is presented. If a question is answered incorrectly ten seconds will be subtracted from the clock. The game ends when the timer reaches zero or all questions are answered. The score and initials of the player may be saved when the game is over. 

Developing this code increased my knowlege of HTML, CSS and JavaScript especially the use arrays and functions.
